# Recommender_systems
Various Recommender System models tested on different datasets

In this I will be testing the different recommender system models and their approach I will try to explain.
This is not my work in particular but a collection of different works on different datasets and here I have explained the dataset and the approach that is used to tackle the problem.

Also I will be comparing the results obtained after different approaches.

LIGHTFM is going to be the main library that we use because this provides easy Hybrid models and for the best performance I will compare with the FASTAI approach which provides one of the best results when the approach is pure matrix factorization.
